  ## Energy Aware Mining

  This page contains pointers to all the primary data we used to conduct our study on energy-aware commits, please refer to them below.

  ## [Analysis Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QWa4nGL8U4EK1B5oA79eEVl7fFpD36CAoVwct0yMj3E/edit?usp=sharing) ##
  This spreadsheet is a public Google Spreadsheet document that holds all the results of our analysis. Download it [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QWa4nGL8U4EK1B5oA79eEVl7fFpD36CAoVwct0yMj3E/edit?usp=sharing).

  It includes the following sheets:

  - __Dashboard__: contains aggregated data about overall statistics discussed in the paper.
  - __Analysis__: contains the bulk of the commits data and it also contains the final theme assigned to each commit.
  - __ChangesStatistics__: contains data and statistics related to the size of the changes and number of files touched.
  - __HedgingChangesStatistics__: contains data and statistics related to the size of the changes and number of files touched for the commits containing hedging instances.
  - __ProjectsStatistics__: contains data and statistics for the projects of the analyzed commits. 
  - __Trends__: contains consolidated information about the number of commits per stack level for each month in the commits sample time range.
  - __EnergyAwareSet__: a helper sheet to enable the summaries presented in the __Dashboard__ sheet.


  ## [MongoDb Dump](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_wz-3gJt0yTVUlaSURRZGswd0U/view?usp=sharing) ##

  This dump contais GitHub metadata about users, repositories and commits and is primarily meant to be used for replication purposes since some of GitHub's data may become inaccessible*. Download it [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_wz-3gJt0yTVUlaSURRZGswd0U/view?usp=sharing)

  It contains the following collections:

  - __users__: [User metadata for repository owners](https://developer.github.com/v3/users/#get-a-single-user).
  - __repos__: [Repository metadata](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/#get).
  - __commits__: [Commits metadata](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/commits/#get-a-single-commit).
  - __committers__: [User metadata for commit committers](https://developer.github.com/v3/users/#get-a-single-user).
  - __authors__: [User metadata for commit authors](https://developer.github.com/v3/users/#get-a-single-user).


  *Some of the metadata was already not available when trying to download it from Github. This might be due to several reasons: the project could have been renamed or removed, the project owner may have left Github, or the branch where the commit was placed was removed.
